# ILY-Spam-Virus
This is a virus I made as a prank.  It spams your computer with pop ups until it crashes.  I designed it to be 100% harmless.
Keep all contents inside the ILY folder for this to work properly. Starting the batch file named "I Love You" will launch the virus.
The virus can be stopped by rebooting your computer, OR running the included antivirus batch file. The folder can be moved anywhere
as a whole... Including thumb drives *wink wink*. I am also including an icon that can be used in any shortcut you may create.

IF YOU WANT TO ACCESS THIS FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE IN YOUR COMPUTER, CREATE A SHORTCUT!! ONCE AGAIN, DO NOT TAKE CONTENTS OUT OF ILY FOLDER

DISCLAIMER
Although this is 100% harmless, it still makes the computer useless for a short amount of time.  If you get in trouble, that's on you.  
Additionally, if you choose to edit the batch files, I do not take responsibility for any harm you cause to anyone's computer.
